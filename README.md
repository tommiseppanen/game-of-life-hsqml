HsQML implementation of Game of Life

After reading the book "Programming in Haskell" by Graham Huttom, I wanted to  go back to the game of life example and implement own version of it with a graphical user interface. I did quick search of Haskell GUI libraries and found out that there exists Haskell bindings for Qt Quick. I was familiar with Qt but I didn't have any experience with QML so I decided that now is the perfect time to try it out.
